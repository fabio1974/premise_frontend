# Premise Frontend React.js Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A React.js application with CRUD operations, a movie image dashboard, and security for Authentication/Authorization.

## Reaching the backend
Before run this application you can change [config.json](config.json) to change the 'apiUrl' to the backend which is documented  and published
[here](https://github.com/fabio1974/premise_backend/blob/main/README.md). The value of that variable wil depend on where you publish the backend.

## Admin User
After run the application with the steps shown bellow, you can login as Administrator:

### ` 1. user email : premise@andela.com`
### ` 2. password: 12345` 


You can also create a non-admin user in the 'Register' option at the top of the Navbar
